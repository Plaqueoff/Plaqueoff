# Hello There!

My name is Pekka and I'm currently studying for a masters degree in computer science at the University of Eastern Finland. Below you can find coding projects 
I've been part of or done by myself and descriptions of these projects.


## Whiteboard
A JavaFX application which allowed several people to draw on a shared whiteboard simultaneously. It also had a chat function.
I coded handling of drawing data on cliend and serverside, drawing said data on the clients' canvases, few of the UI elements and few drawing tools.
## Maze Solving Robot Car
A Webots/Python/java project where the python code creates a maze for the webots robot car to solve and the java controller handled robot car solves the maze in a BFS
basis.
A solo project, with the knowledge that the code will run on a simulator where the speed can be increased. The code is functional but it is somewhat slow.
## Battleship Browser Game
A JavaScript/React application that makes it possible for two people to play the game battleship on a browser.
I coded the creation of the board and most of the UI updates for hovering, placing mines and the like. I also created the visuals for the game.
## Detecting the Number of Bottles in a Crate
A project where i implemented binary dilation, edge detection and hough algorithm to detect glass bottles in an image.
A solo project.
